  Binary trees are an instance of the graph data structure.
  Why Use Binary Trees?
    In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children,
    which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 
    It combines the advantages of two other structures: an ordered array and a linked list.
      You can search a tree quickly, as you can an ordered array
      And you can also insert and delete items quickly, as you can with a linked list (GM: presumably because you are on average halving your nodes that you have to traverse)
  (GM: it seems that searching a binary tree is O(log n) time)
